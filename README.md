👍 Got it! I see from your screenshot that your repo is **Student-Registration** and it contains PHP files like `home.php`, `login.php`, `dashboard.php`, `index_1.php` plus a `database` folder and `css/bootstrap`.

Here’s a clean **README.md** you can use for your repo:

---

```markdown
# 🎓 Student Registration System

A simple **Student Registration System** built with **PHP** and **MySQL**.  
This project allows students to register, log in, and manage their details, while the admin can view the registered students via a dashboard.

Do you want me to also create a **sample SQL file** (`student_db.sql`) for your `database/` folder, so you can include it in your repo?
